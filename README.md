# Breast Cancer Prediction

This project aims to predict the occurrence of breast cancer using machine learning techniques. It includes the necessary steps to train a model, store it using Pickle, and deploy it on Flask to create a web application for breast cancer prediction.

## Dataset

The breast cancer dataset used in this project is the [Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29). It contains various features derived from digitized images of breast masses, along with corresponding labels indicating whether the masses are malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous).

## Model Training

The model for breast cancer prediction has been trained using machine learning algorithms, such as logistic regression, decision trees, or support vector machines. The dataset has been preprocessed, including feature scaling, handling missing values, and feature engineering, to ensure optimal model performance.

## Model Persistence with Pickle

The trained model has been serialized and stored using Pickle, a Python library for object serialization. The serialized model file is used for prediction in the Flask web application.

## Flask Web Application

The Flask framework has been utilized to develop a web application that allows users to input breast mass characteristics and obtain a prediction of whether the mass is likely to be malignant or benign. The serialized model is loaded into the application and used to make real-time predictions based on user inputs.

## Prerequisites

To run the Breast Cancer Prediction project locally, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Flask
- Scikit-learn
- Pickle

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/breast-cancer-prediction.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Start the Flask web application:

```
python app.py
```

4. Access the web application in your browser at `http://localhost:5000`.

5. Enter the relevant breast mass characteristics in the provided form and submit it to obtain the prediction.

## Future Improvements

- Include more advanced machine learning algorithms and ensemble methods for improved prediction performance.
- Enhance the user interface and add additional functionalities to the web application.
- Integrate with a database for storing user data and maintaining a history of predictions.
